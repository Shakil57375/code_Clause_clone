## design choices

## challenges

I faced challenges while trying to implement AOS animation on my website. Although I managed to add the AOS animation successfully, it destroyed the responsiveness of my website. Therefore, I removed it. I then faced another challenge while implementing counters on the "Our Success" section, and I sought help from YouTube.

In the meantime, I completed the entire website within 24 hours. However, I was confused about where to submit my assignment, so I messaged Internshala. Unfortunately, I received a reply quite late, and once I confirmed the submission process, I started working on the assignment.
