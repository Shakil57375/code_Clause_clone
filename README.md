## design choices

I have chosen the design of https://internship.codeclause.com/

## challenges

I faced challenges while trying to implement AOS animation on my website. Although I managed to add the AOS animation successfully, it destroyed the responsiveness of my website. Therefore, I removed it. I then faced another challenge while implementing counters on the "Our Success" section, and I sought help from YouTube.

In the meantime, I completed the entire website within 24 hours. However, I was confused about where to submit my assignment, so I messaged Internshala. Unfortunately, I received a reply quite late, and once I confirmed the submission process, I started working on the assignment.

## additional features

    -- I was given a task to implement the following components for a website:
        + A responsive navigation bar with a logo
        + A visually appealing hero section with a background image or video, heading, subheading, and call-to-action button
        + A features section to highlight key features with icons and descriptions
        + A testimonials section that includes three testimonials with names and profile pictures
        + A footer section with links to About Us, Contact, Terms, and social media icons.

    -- In addition to the above components
        + section with an image and social media links, as well as a contact us section.
